#### DeepFM
- How to deal with feature crossing?
- MLP could fit any function under condition: unlimited layers and nodes(not realistic). so we need feature crossing to make it more efficient and possible.
- DeepFM is based on Wide&Deep，use FM to repalce Wide part，which improve the feature combination of the shallow nn. And output layer combines FM output and Deep part output.
  - uses inner product of embedding vectors to do feature crossing
- NFM (Neural Factorization Machines) uses another way to do feature crossing:
  - Bi-Interaction Pooling: Element-wise Product, then add up (pooling) instead of concatenate
- 深度学习中没有什么不可以的，有的只是提出思路，改进模型，和验证效果。
