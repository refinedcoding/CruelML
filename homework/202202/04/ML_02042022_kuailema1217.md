##### Classification from the long lecture + 4400 notes review
- Generative Model (Estimating the probabilities from training data)
- with MLE (maximizing likelihood estimator) to decide the parameters values
  - iid (independent and identically distributed) is the assumption of MLE
  - MLE: to use the parameters values which maximizes the data likelihood (**joint density of the data**)
- e.g. Gaussian Distribution
  - LDA: linear hyperplane (same covariance matrix among classes)
  - QDA: quadratic hyperplane (different covariance matrix among classes)
- can use any distributions you like
  - e.g. if binary features: bernoulli distributions
  - e.g. if all features are independent: Naive Bayes Classifier
- Generative Model => params 演算过程, seems overkill (next part will talk about)
