- 2> GD (see 3.1.1.4 https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-networks/linear-regression.html)
  - hyperparameters:
    - lr (not too small/large)
    - batch size (usually use a batch, as data is too large)
#### 3.2 Linear Regression Implementation from Scratch
- with tensor in torch
- see: https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-networks/linear-regression-scratch.html
#### 3.3 
- with libs in torch
- see: https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-networks/linear-regression-concise.html
- <=> the one implemented from scratch in 3.2
