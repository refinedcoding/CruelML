### 实战
- 让合适的平台做合适的事情:
  - Spark: data processing
  - Flink: stream processing
  - TensorFlow: modeling and training
#### Features
- Categories
  - 1. Item features
    - Basic features
    - Statistical features (Spark: with groupby)
  - 2. User features
    - Basic features
    - Statistical features (Spark: with groupby)
      - historical behavior features
  - 3. Context features
    - Time, date, etc.
- Be care of data leakage (use info outside of training data)
  - use testing data (Future Information) to help generating features for training
  - e.g. used rating in testing to compute average rating to use in training...
  - solution: 
    - 1> moving window
    - 2> feature snapshot
- Online: saved in Redis (key: value, keys e.g. user_id, item_id)
