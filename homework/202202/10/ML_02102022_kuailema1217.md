### 推荐模型篇
#### Collaborative Filtering
- 协同过滤：协同大家的反馈、评价和意见一起对海量的信息进行过滤，从中筛选出用户可能感兴趣的信息
- Steps:
  - 1. Define similar users (e.g. by consine similarity b/w each user's item score vector)
  - 2. Do estimation: weighted score (sum(similar users' score * similar score)/sum(similar scores))
- issue: if co-occurrence matrix is sparse, inaccurate similarity
- Improvement: matrix decomposition -  to decompose the co-occurrence matrix to get the vectors of users and items (in the same space)
  - Gradient Descent on the loss function:
    - r is the rating in the matrix，q is item vector，p is user vector，K is the set of all users and items.
  - e.g. (including regularization) - also see P25 in the book
    - all the computation above would be done for each user (update **p**u) and each item (update **q**i).
#### DL Revolution
- Improvement with DL
  - 1. model's fitting ability improves a lot
  - 2. DL could use the model structure to simulate users' interest evolution, user's attention machanism and other users' activities.
- model improvement directions:
  - 改变神经网络的复杂程度. e.g. Deep Crossing
  - 改变特征交叉方式 e.g. NeuralCF
  - 把多种模型组合应用 e.g. Wide&Deep
  - 让深度推荐模型和其他领域进行交叉 e.g. DIN
#### TensorFlow
- Any model --convert--> DAG
  - 1. modularization
  - 2. decide which nodes excute in parallel or in sequences
    - e.g. fig 6-16 in P200
    - The Parallelism of TensorFlow is lower level than Spark
- In each worker node: (like a simple version of Parameter Server)
  - CPU: data and task management
  - GPU: high intense tensor computation
