### Deep & Cross Network for Ad Click Predictions
- Extension of Wide & Deep, improve the wide part: use Cross Network to replace Wide.
- Reason (Feature engineering):
  - manual FE
    - requires nontrivial work or exhaustive searching.
  - DNN
    - automatical feature interactions learning generates all implicit interactions, whic is not necessarily efficient in learning all types of cross features.
  - Proposed **Deep & Cross Network (DCN)** introduces a novel cross network
    - efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature
    - feature crossing at each layer requires no manual FE
    - negligible extra complexity to DNN
- Cross Network

  - <=> [交叉项 (crossing features), but b/w layers xj with xk](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\overrightarrow{x_{l&plus;1}}=\begin{bmatrix}w_{1}x_{01}x_{l1}&plus;w_{2}x_{01}x_{l2}&plus;w_{3}x_{01}x_{l3}&plus;bx_{l1}&plus;x_{l1}&space;\\w_{1}x_{02}x_{l1}&plus;w_{2}x_{02}x_{l2}&plus;w_{3}x_{02}x_{l3}&plus;bx_{l2}&plus;x_{l2}&space;\\w_{1}x_{03}x_{l1}&plus;w_{2}x_{03}x_{l2}&plus;w_{3}x_{03}x_{l3}&plus;bx_{l3}&plus;x_{l3}&space;\\\end{bmatrix})
  - notes: first one is input with input (x0 cross x0, refer to the book & paper)
- The model framework (refer to the paper Fig 1)
