### Steps in a ML system design interview
1. Ask questions (what, who, how, etc.)
   - get the shape of the problem, e.g. what kind of recommender system; what kind of query to receive.
   - => narrow it down to a precise ML problem
2. Understand system requirement
   - scale (e.g. QPS)
   - latency (e.g. P99)
   - => to decide the model complexity accordingly
3. Define metrics to meature system performance
   - offline
   - online (component-wise metrics & end-to-end metrics)
4. Architecture
   - key components
   - end-to-end data flow
5. Offline model building and evaluation
   - training data generation
   - feature engineering
   - model training (considering performance & capacity)
   - offline evaluation
6. Online model execution and evaluation
   - A/B testing
     - if didn't see offline improvement online, why
   - monitor the performance
7. Iterative model improvement
