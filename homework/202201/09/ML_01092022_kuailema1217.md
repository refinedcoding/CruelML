### Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems

Wide:
- Usage: memorization of feature interactions (direct, Co-occurance - 记忆能力，解释力)
- Model: logistic regression
- Effect: effective and interpretable
- Shortage: generalization requires more feature engineering effort

Deep
- Usage: better generalization (indirect relevance, complex feature interactions - 泛化能力，表达力)
- Model: deep nn
- Effect: learns unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features
- Shortage: can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank

Wide & Deep:
memorization & generalization
- Results: increased app acquisitions compared with one-side-only models (Google Play data)
- Loss function: Logloss
- Key: good understanding of the business (features): which to put to wide / deep; transformations
